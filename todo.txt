 I have a stash, not very helpful :/
 I think I was going to try and kick it on tab change, but... hitting enter gives a warning too.
 starting to suspect that I'm doing something wrong there that's more important and might change tab-change behaviour.
try using the stuff I figured out at work - the onFragmentChange method (did I blog that?) and check the event handling in that edittext helper class...

backups:
make a web-app folder (in here or alongside?)
get hello-world up
copy paper todolist in here

journal:
*shade
show journal timestamps
prettier mode display
decide how to use mode data

todo UI:
*-completed
-item editing
-exact dates
-date buckets system
-details, priority.. status? (delegated, waiting, etc)
-tags
-custom resolution (done, wontfix, dup, etc)
